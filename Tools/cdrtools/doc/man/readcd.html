<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>Readcd</B>

is used to read or write Compact Discs.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Device naming</H3>

Most users do not need to care about device naming at all.
If no
<B>dev=</B>

option was specified, 
<B>readcd</B>

implements 
<B>auto target</B>

support and automagically finds the drive in case that exactly
one CD-ROM type drive is available in the system.
In case that more than one CD-ROM type drive exists on the system,
a list of possible device name parameters may be retrieved with
<B>readcd -scanbus</B>

or from the target example from the output of
<B>readcd dev=help</B>,

then the
<B>dev=</B>

parameter may be set based on the device listing.
<P>

The
<I>device</I>

parameter to the
<B>dev=</B>

option
explained below refers to the
<B>SCSI&nbsp;CAM</B>

standard notation for
<I>scsibus</I>/<I>target</I>/<I>lun</I>

of the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder.
If a file /etc/default/cdrecord exists, the parameter to the
<B>dev=</B>

option may also be a drive name label in said file (see FILES section).
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

If no options except the 
<I>dev=</I>

option have been specified, 
<B>readcd</B>

goes into interactive mode.
Select a primary function and then follow the instructions.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Informative options</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-help</B>

<DD>
display version information for
<B>readcd</B>

on standard output.
<DT><B>-version</B>

<DD>
Print version information and exit.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Increment the level of general verbosity by one.
This is used e.g. to display the progress of the process.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Readcd functional options</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-clone</B>

<DD>
Do a clone read. Read the CD with all sub-channel data and a full TOC.
The full TOC data will be put into a file with similar name as with the
<B>f=</B>

option but the suffix 
<B>.toc</B>

added.
<P>
Note that reading in
<B>clone</B>

mode results in having no error correction at sub-channel level. Even in the main data channel,
there is less error correction than with other read modes. This results in a slightly quality
degradation. Avoid copying audio CDs in 
<B>clone</B>

mode for this reason.
<DT><B>-c2scan</B>

<DD>
Scans the whole CD or the range specified by the 
<B>sectors=</B><I>range</I>

for C2 errors. C2 errors are errors that are uncorrectable after the second
stage of the 24/28 + 28/32 Reed Solomon correction system at audio level
(2352 bytes sector size). If an audio CD has C2 errors, interpolation is needed
to hide the errors. If a data CD has C2 errors, these errors are in most
cases corrected by the ECC/EDC code that makes 2352 bytes out of 2048 data
bytes. The ECC/EDC code should be able to correct about 100 C2 error bytes
per sector.
<P>
If you find C2 errors you may want to reduce the speed using the
<B>speed=</B>

option as C2 errors may be a result of dynamic unbalance on the medium.
<DT><B>-cxscan</B>

<DD>
Scans the whole CD or the range specified by the 
<B>sectors=</B><I>range</I>

for C1/C2/CU errors.
In non-verbose mode, only a summary is printed.
With
<B>-v</B>,

a line for each non error free second is printed.
with
<B>-vv</B>,

a line for each second is printed.
This scan method only works for a few drives.
<DT><B>-edc-corr</B>

<DD>
In this mode,
<B>readcd</B>

reads CD data sectors in uncorrected audio mode 
and then tries to correct the data using the ECC/EDC decoder library

from Heiko Eissfeldt. As this library implements looping over two layers
of error correction, 
<B>readcd</B>

may be able to correct more data than the firmware of the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
This option is currently experimental and only applicable with 
CD media and currently only supports
plain 2048 Byte CD-ROM sectors.
<DT><B>f=</B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Specify the filename where the output should be written or the input should
be taken from. Using '-' as filename will cause
<B>readcd</B>

to use 
<B>stdout</B> resp. <B>stdin</B>.

<DT><B>-factor</B>

<DD>
Output the speed values for
<B>meshpoints=</B>#

as factor based on 
<I>single speed</I>

of the current medium.
This only works if
<B>readcd</B>

is able to determine the current medium type.
<DT><B>-fulltoc</B>

<DD>
Retrieve a full TOC from the current disk and print it in hex.
<DT><B>meshpoints=</B>#

<DD>
Print read-speed at # locations.
The purpose of this option is to create a list of read speed values suitable
for e.g.
<B>gnuplot</B>.

The speed values are calculated assuming that 1000 bytes are one kilobyte
as documented in the SCSI standard.
The output data created for this purpose is written to 
<I>stdout</I>.

<DT><B>-nocorr</B>

<DD>
Switch the drive into a mode where it ignores read errors in data sectors that
are a result of uncorrectable ECC/EDC errors before reading.
If
<B>readcd</B>

completes, the error recovery mode of the drive is switched back to the remembered 
old mode.
<DT><B>-noerror</B>

<DD>
Do not abort if the high level error checking in
<B>readcd</B>

found an uncorrectable error in the data stream.
<DT><B>-notrunc</B>

<DD>
Do not truncate the output file when opening it.
<DT><B>-overhead</B>

<DD>
Meter the SCSI command overhead time.
This is done by executing several commands 1000 times and printing the
total time used. If you divide the displayed times by 1000, you get 
the average overhead time for a single command.
<DT><B>-pi8scan</B>

<DD>
Scans the whole DVD or the range specified by the 
<B>sectors=</B><I>range</I>

for 
<B>pisum8</B>

errors.
In non-verbose mode, only a summary is printed.
With
<B>-v</B>,

a line for each non error free block of 8 * 32 kB is printed.
with
<B>-vv</B>,

a line for each block of 8 * 32 kB is printed.
This scan method only works for a few drives.
<DT><B>-pifscan</B>

<DD>
Scans the whole DVD or the range specified by the 
<B>sectors=</B><I>range</I>

for 
<B>pif</B>

errors.
In non-verbose mode, only a summary is printed.
With
<B>-v</B>,

a line for each non error free block of 32 kB is printed.
with
<B>-vv</B>,

a line for each block of 32 kB is printed.
This scan method only works for a few drives.
<DT><B>-plot</B>

<DD>
This option modified the behavior for
<B>-cxscan</B>,

<B>-pi8scan</B>

and
<B>-pifscan</B>.

The output is better suited for gnuplot.
<DT><B>retries=</B><I>#</I>

<DD>
Set the retry count for high level retries in
<B>readcd</B>

to 
<I>#</I>.

The default is to do 128 retries which may be too much if you like to read a CD
with many unreadable sectors.
<DT><B>sectors=</B><I>range</I>

<DD>
Specify a sector range that should be read.
The range is specified by the starting sector number, a minus sign and the
ending sector number.
The end sector is not included in the list, so 
<B>sectors=</B>0-0

will not read anything and may be used to check for a CD in the drive.
<DT><B>speed=</B>#

<DD>
Set the speed factor of the read or write process to #.
# is an integer, representing a multiple of the audio speed.
This is about 150 KB/s for CD-ROM and about 172 KB/s for CD-Audio.
If no 
<I>speed</I>

option is present, 
<B>readcd</B>

will use maximum speed.
Only MMC compliant drives will benefit from this option.
The speed of non MMC drives is not changed.
<P>
Using a lower speed may increase the readability of a CD or DVD.
<DT><B>-w</B>

<DD>
Switch to write mode.
Writing is only possible to DVD-RAM media. For other media, use
<B>cdrecord</B>

instead.
Note that 
<B>cdrecord</B>

also supports to write DVD-RAM media.
<P>
If this option is not present,
<B>readcd</B>

reads from the specified device.

<H3>SCSI options</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>dev=</B><I>target</I>

<DD>
Set the SCSI target for the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder, see notes above.
A typical target device specification is
<B>dev=</B><I>1,6,0</I>

.
If a filename must be provided together with the numerical target 
specification, the filename is implementation specific.
The correct filename in this case can be found in the system specific
manuals of the target operating system.
On a 
<I>FreeBSD</I>

system without 
<I>CAM</I>

support, you need to use the control device (e.g.
<I>/dev/rcd0.ctl</I>).

A correct device specification in this case may be
<B>dev=</B><I>/dev/rcd0.ctl:@</I>

.
<P>
<B>General SCSI addressing</B>

<BR>

The
<I>target device</I>

to the 
<B>dev=</B>

option
refers to the
<B>SCSI&nbsp;CAM</B>

standard notation for
<I>scsibus</I>/<I>target</I>/<I>lun</I>

of the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder. Communication on 
<I>SunOS</I>

is done with the SCSI general driver
<B>scg.</B>

Other operating systems are using a library simulation of this driver.
Possible syntax is:
<B>dev=</B>

<I>scsibus</I>,<I>target</I>,<I>lun</I>

or
<B>dev=</B>

<I>target</I>,<I>lun</I>.

In the latter case, the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder has to be connected to the default 
SCSI bus of the machine.
<I>Scsibus</I>,

<I>target </I>

and 
<I>lun</I>

are integer numbers. 
Some operating systems or SCSI transport implementations may require to
specify a filename in addition.
In this case the correct syntax for the device is:
<B>dev=</B>

<I>devicename</I>:<I>scsibus</I>,<I>target</I>,<I>lun</I>

or
<B>dev=</B>

<I>devicename</I>:<I>target</I>,<I>lun</I>.

If the name of the device node that has been specified on such a system
refers to exactly one SCSI device, a shorthand in the form
<B>dev=</B>

<I>devicename</I>:<I>@</I>

or
<B>dev=</B>

<I>devicename</I>:<I>@</I>,<I>lun</I>

may be used instead of
<B>dev=</B>

<I>devicename</I>:<I>scsibus</I>,<I>target</I>,<I>lun</I>.

<P>
<B>Remote SCSI addressing</B>

<BR>

To access remote SCSI devices, you need to prepend the SCSI device name by
a remote device indicator. The remote device indicator is either
<B>REMOTE:</B><I><A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A>:</I>

or
<B>REMOTE:</B><I>host:</I>

A valid remote SCSI device name may be:
<B>REMOTE:</B><I><A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A>:</I>

to allow remote SCSI bus scanning or
<B>REMOTE:</B><I><A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A>:1,0,0</I>

to access the SCSI device at 
<I>host</I>

connected to SCSI bus # 1,target 0, lun 0.
In order to allow remote access to a specific
<I>host</I>,

the
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+rscsi">rscsi</A></B>(1)

program needs to be present and configured on the
<I>host</I>.

<P>
<B>Alternate SCSI transports</B>

<BR>

<B>Cdrecord</B>

is completely based on 
<B>SCSI</B>

commands but this is no problem as all CD/DVD/BluRay writers
ever made use
<B>SCSI</B>

commands for the communication. Even
<B>ATAPI</B>

drives are just
<B>SCSI</B>

drives that inherently use the 
<I>ATA packet interface</I>

as
<B>SCSI</B>

command transport layer build into the IDE (ATA) transport.
You may need to specify an alternate transport layer on the command  line
if your OS does not implement a fully integrated kernel driver subsystem that
allows to access any drive using
<B>SCSI</B>

commands via a single unique user interface.
<P>
To access SCSI devices via alternate transport layers,
you need to prepend the SCSI device name by a transport layer indicator.
The transport layer indicator may be something like
<B>USCSI: </B>

or
<B>ATAPI:</B>.

To get a list of supported transport layers for your platform, use 
<B>dev=</B>

<I>HELP</I>:

<P>
<B>Portability Background</B>

<BR>

To make 
<B>readcd</B>

portable to all <FONT SIZE="-2">UNIX</FONT> platforms, the syntax
<B>dev=</B>

<I>devicename</I>:<I>scsibus</I>,<I>target</I>,<I>lun</I>

is preferred as it hides OS specific knowledge about device names from the user.
A specific OS may not necessarily support a way to specify a real device file name nor a
way to specify 
<I>scsibus</I>,<I>target</I>,<I>lun</I>.

<P>
<I>Scsibus </I>

0 is the default SCSI bus on the machine. Watch the boot messages for more 
information or look into 
<B>/var/adm/messages </B>

for more information about the SCSI configuration of your machine.
If you have problems to figure out what values for 
<I>scsibus</I>,<I>target</I>,<I>lun</I>

should be used, try the 
<B>-scanbus</B>

option of 
<B>readcd</B>

described below.
<P>
<B>Using logical names for devices</B>

<BR>

If no 
<I>dev</I>

option is present, 
<B>readcd</B>

will try to get the device from the 
<B>CDR_DEVICE</B>

environment.
<P>
If a file /etc/default/cdrecord exists, and
if the argument to the
<B>dev=</B>

option
or the
<B>CDR_DEVICE</B>

environment
does not contain the characters ',', '/', '@' or ':',
it is interpreted as a device label name that was defined in the file
/etc/default/cdrecord (see FILES section).
<P>
<B>Autotarget Mode</B>

<BR>

If no 
<B>dev=</B>

option 
and no
<B>CDR_DEVICE</B>

environment
is present, or if it
only contains a transport specifyer but no address notation,
<B>readcd</B>

tries to scan the SCSI address space for CD-ROM drives.
If exactly one is found, this is used by default.
<DT><B>debug=</B><I>#, </I><B>-d</B>

<DD>
Set the misc debug value to # (with debug=#) or increment
the misc debug level by one (with -d). If you specify
<I>-dd,</I>

this equals to 
<B>debug=</B><I>2.</I>

This may help to find problems while opening a driver for libscg.
as well as with sector sizes and sector types.
Using
<B>-debug</B>

slows down the process and may be the reason for a buffer underrun.
<DT><B>kdebug=</B>#, <B>kd=</B>#

<DD>
Tell the 
<B>scg</B>-driver

to modify the kernel debug value while SCSI commands are running.
<DT><B>-scanbus</B>

<DD>
Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and print the inquiry
strings. This option may be used to find SCSI address of the 
devices on a system.
The numbers printed out as labels are computed by: 
<B>bus * 100 + target</B>

<DT><B>scgopts=</B><I>list</I>

<DD>
A comma separated list of SCSI options that are handled by libscg.
The implemented options may be uptated indepentendly from applications.
Currently, one option:
<B>ignore-resid</B>

is supported to work around a Linux kernel bug.
<DT><B>-silent</B>, <B>-s</B>

<DD>
Do not print out a status report for failed SCSI commands.
<DT><B>spt=</B><I>#</I>

<DD>
Set the maximum number of sectors per transfer.
<DT><B>timeout=</B><I>#</I>

<DD>
Set the default SCSI command timeout value to 
<I>#</I> seconds.

The default SCSI command timeout is the minimum timeout used for sending
SCSI commands.
If a SCSI command fails due to a timeout, you may try to raise the
default SCSI command timeout above the timeout value of the failed command.
If the command runs correctly with a raised command timeout,
please report the better timeout value and the corresponding command to 
the author of the program.
If no 
<I>timeout </I>

option is present, a default timeout of 40 seconds is used.
<DT><B>ts=</B>#

<DD>
Set the maximum transfer size for a single SCSI command to #.
The syntax for the 
<B>ts=</B>

option is the same as for cdrecord fs=# or sdd bs=#.
<P>
If no 
<B>ts=</B>

option has been specified,
<B>readcd</B>

defaults to a transfer size of 256 kB. If libscg gets lower values from the
operating system, the value is reduced to the maximum value that is possible
with the current operating system.
Sometimes, it may help to further reduce the transfer size or to enhance it,
but note that it may take a long time to find a better value by experimenting
with the
<B>ts=</B>

option.
<DT><B>-V</B>

<DD>
Increment the verbose level with respect of SCSI command transport by one.
This helps to debug problems
during the process, that occur in the CD-Recorder. 
If you get incomprehensible error messages you should use this flag
to get more detailed output.
<B>-VV</B>

will show data buffer content in addition.
Using
<B>-V</B>

or
<B>-VV</B>

slows down the process.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>RSH</B>

<DD>
If the 
<B>RSH</B>

environment is present, the remote connection will not be created via
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+rcmd">rcmd</A></B>(3)

but by calling the program pointed to by
<B>RSH</B>.

Use e.g. 
<B>RSH=</B>/usr/bin/ssh

to create a secure shell connection.
<P>
Note that this forces 
<B>cdrecord</B>

to create a pipe to the 
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+rsh">rsh</A>(1)</B>

program and disallows
<B>cdrecord</B>

to directly access the network socket to the remote server.
This makes it impossible to set up performance parameters and slows down
the connection compared to a 
<B>root</B>

The following exit codes are used:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>0</B>

<DD>
No error appeared.
<DT><B>-1</B>

<DD>
A specific error appeared. This may be a usage error caused by an illegal command line

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

If you don't want to allow users to become root on your system,
<B>readcd</B>

may safely be installed suid root. This allows all users or a group of
users with no root privileges to use 
<B>readcd.</B>

<B>Readcd</B>

in this case will only allow access to CD-ROM type drives-
To give all user access to use 
<B>readcd, </B>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>chmod 4710 /usr/local/bin/readcd<BR>
<P>

and add a group 
<I>cdburners</I>

on your system.
<P>

Never give write permissions for non root users to the 
<I>/dev/scg?</I>

devices unless you would allow anybody to read/write/format
all your disks.
<P>

You should not connect old drives that do not support
disconnect/reconnect to either the SCSI bus that is connected to the
CD-Recorder or the source disk.
<P>

When using 
<B>readcd</B>

with the 
<B>Linux SCSI generic driver.</B>

You should note that 
<B>readcd</B>

uses a layer, that tries to emulate the functionality of the scg driver
on top of the drives of the local operating system.
Unfortunately, the sg driver on 
<B>Linux</B>

has several flaws:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
It cannot see if a SCSI command could not be sent at all.
<DT>*<DD>
It cannot get the SCSI status byte. 
<B>Readcd</B>

for that reason cannot report failing SCSI commands in some
situations.
<DT>*<DD>
It cannot get real DMA count of transfer. 
<B>Readcd</B>

cannot tell you if there is an DMA residual count.
<DT>*<DD>
It cannot get number of bytes valid in auto sense data.
<B>Readcd</B>

cannot tell you if device transfers no sense data at all.

It fetches to few data in auto request sense (CCS/SCSI-2/SCSI-3 needs &gt;= 18).

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>

<P>

<P>

A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
readcd: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no error
CDB:  00 20 00 00 00 00
status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 25 00 00 00 00 00
Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0
Sense Code: 0x25 Qual 0x00 (logical unit not supported) Fru 0x0
Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid)
cmd finished after 0.002s timeout 40s
</PRE>

<P>
</DL>

The first line gives information about the transport of the command.
The text after the first colon gives the error text for the system call
from the view of the kernel. It usually is:
<B>I/O error</B>

unless other problems happen. The next words contain a short description for
the SCSI command that fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were
any problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
<B>fatal error</B>

means that it was not possible to transport the command (i.e. no device present
at the requested SCSI address).
<P>

The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block for the failed command.
<P>

The third line gives information on the SCSI status code returned by the 
command, if the transport of the command succeeds. 
This is error information from the SCSI device.
<P>

The fourth line is a hex dump of the auto request sense information for the 
command.
<P>

The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if available, followed
by the segment number that is only valid if the command was a
<I>copy</I>

command. If the error message is not directly related to the current command,
the text
<I>deferred error</I>

is appended.
<P>

The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and the sense qualifier if available.
If the type of the device is known, the sense data is decoded from tables
in
<I>scsierrs.c</I> .

The text is followed by the error value for a field replaceable unit.
<P>

The seventh line prints the block number that is related to the failed command
and text for several error flags. The block number may not be valid.
<P>

The eight line reports the timeout set up for this command and the time
that the command really needed to complete.

<H2>INTERFACE STABILITY</H2>

The interfaces provided by 
<B>readcd</B>

are designed for long term stability.
As
<B>readcd</B>

depends on interfaces provided by the underlying operating system,
the stability of the interfaces offered by
<B>readcd</B>

depends on the interface stability of the OS interfaces. 
Modified interfaces in the OS may enforce modified interfaces
in 
<B>readcd</B>.
