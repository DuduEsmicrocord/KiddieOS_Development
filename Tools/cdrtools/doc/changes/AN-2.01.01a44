Please have a look at the German open Source Center BerliOS at www.berlios.de
BerliOS will continue to support free hosting of cryptography projects even
when US laws change and don't allow to host cryptography projects in the USA.
Also look at sourcewell.berlios.de, the first Open Source announcement service
that itself is implemented as Open Source project.

NEW features of cdrtools-2.01.01a44:

*******
NOTE: cdrtools is currently in a state just before a new major release.
	

*******


All:

-	New directory autoconf/ contains the complete Schily autoconf system.
	It is based on GNU autoconf-2.13, the latest GNU autoconf that worked
	correctly even on older systems.

-	Sources and makefilesystem restructured to allow all needed files to be
	retrieved from the SCCS repository and to call "make" later. To achieve
	this, all symlinks have been removed from the tarball.

-	The Schily Makefile System now includes rules to recreate the file
	"configure" by calling "autoconf". This is needed in order to allow the 
	complete source tree to be extracted from the SCCS repository.

Libschily:

	HELIOS TODO:

	-	Add the HELIOS UNICODE mapping code. This needs to be done 
		at UCS-2 level for Joliet and UDF (instead of UTF-8) and only
		for Rock Ridge (in case of a UTF-8 based target locale) using
		UTF-8 based translations.

	-	Make the Apple extensions work again with "mkisofs -find"

TODO:
	-	Support correct inode numbers for UDF hardlinks

	-	Support sockets, pipes, char/blk-dev specials with UDF

	-	read Joliet filenames with multi-session if no TRANS.TBL
		or RR is present. I am looking for a volunteer for this task!

		Note that this can never be 100% correct as there is no relation
		between the names on the master (UNIX) filesystem, the ISO-9660
		names and the Joliet names. Only the Rock Ridge names are
		untranslated with respect to the original files on the
		master (UNIX) filesystem.

	-	add libecc/edc for CDI and similar.


CYGWIN NT-4.0 NOTES:

To compile on Cygwin32, get Cygwin and install it.
For more information read README.win32

The files are located on:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha ...

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% POSIX compatible. GNU tar may get some
	minor trouble. If you like a 100% POSIX compliant tar, get star from
	ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/star/

WARNING: Do not use 'winzip' to extract the tar file!
	Winzip cannot extract symbolic links correctly.
